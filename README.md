# Laravel
Laravel is a free and open-source PHP web framework,[2] created by Taylor Otwell and intended for the development of web applications following the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern and based on Symfony. Some of the features of Laravel are a modular packaging system with a dedicated dependency manager, different ways for accessing relational databases, utilities that aid in application deployment and maintenance, and its orientation toward syntactic sugar.[3][4]: 2, 5–9 [5][6]  The source code of Laravel is hosted on GitHub and licensed under the terms of MIT License.[7]
